How to use:
- Enable in Site building > Modules page
- Require some modules
  * Book (core)
  * Imagecache
  * Lightbox2
  * Imagefield (optional)
- Set imagecache preset for display image items in Site configuration > Jstree settings (use predefined preset name from imagecache UI).
- This module would get book contents (title / body) and show image list from first imagefield CCK in book type when it exists, another follow imagefield would be ignored.
