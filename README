How to use:
- Enable in Site building > Modules page
- Require some modules
  * Book (core)
  * Imagecache
  * Lightbox2
  * Imagefield (optional)
- Set imagecache preset for display image items in Site configuration > Jstree settings (use predefined preset name from imagecache UI).
- This module would get book contents (title / body) and show image list from first imagefield CCK in book type when it exists, another follow imagefield would be ignored.

Known issues:
- This module works only with 'book' (Book page) content type.
- You couldn't create top-level book page from jstree page, create manually from Content management > create content > Book page.
